# Guidelines
- Branch before doing any updates, push code up, merge it yourself. This allows me to add comments

# To-do

1. What is the app's purpose? Maybe: favorite shows/actors, share those shows with friends on the app, see the forecast for the next 7 days to schedule a time to watch it together.
2. Fill out this README
3. Fill out the "About" section of the project
4. More tests for the service class
5. Search the DB for shows before making the API call, after making the API call save the shows to the DB. AFter step 5, when a user "deletes" a show off their index page, just remove the relationship, don't delete the Show.
6. Add login / register functionality, require users to login before searching
