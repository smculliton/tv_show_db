# Guidelines
- Branch before doing any updates, push code up, merge it yourself. This allows me to add comments

# To-do

1. What is the app's purpose? Maybe: favorite shows/actors, share those shows with friends on the app, see the forecast for the next 7 days to schedule a time to watch it together.

3. Fill out the "About" section of the project
4. Require users to login before searching
5. Create tests for search feature

7. Add unfollow functionality to user dashboard
8. Page where users can see the favorite shows of people they follow
9. When a new user is created, they are automatically logged in


# Finished Tasks
